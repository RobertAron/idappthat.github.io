## Mobi has two types of meetings:
* Mobi LEARN meetings which are one hour workshops over a specific platform. We usually cover Android, iOS, Web, Design, and Embedded systems.
* Our Dev meetings are where Mobi really makes a difference. We spend an hour working on our projects and building products to improve campus life.

We meet every Friday at 5pm in ERB 103 @ UTA
